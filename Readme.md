# Avali Dummy

Tired of your Avali clothes clipping through a human-shape mannequin
while exploring the crafting window?
Have one that more accurately represents your raptor-like body!
This affects the mannequin item too.

Warning: the dummy is replaced for all races, not just Avali.

## Installation

Just put the `avali-dummy` folder (inside `src`)
into your Starbound `mods` folder.

This mod only really makes sense when used with the
[Avali race mod](https://github.com/Avali-Triage-Team/Avali).
